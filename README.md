## Trpquo's unreasonably big project's webpage

Trpimir Jeronim Ježić is a experienced graphic and web designer, currently employed as an assistent teacher and research associate at the Faculty of Graphic Arts at University of Zagreb, based in the Department for Computer Graphics and Multimedia Systems; side-working as an freelance designer/developer; hobbying as an hard-rock musician, GAS sufferer, big philosophical questions and engineering enthusiast, civil sector supporter and a loving dog owner. 
The reason for this site's existence is my great interest in the multidisciplinary field of non-existent _General Graphic Design Theory_ and possibilities of it's implementation in shaping technical approaces and technological solutions to everyday challenges in visual communication.  

###General Graphic Design Theory
**G^2DT** is the theory that would combine theories, findings and consensuses from a broad arrangement of fields such as:
- general layout and composition principles arrived from grapgis/UX/type design and art practices and music theory
- cognitive, bihevioral, gestalt, perceptual, clinical and social psychologies and psychology of art 
- cognitive sciences, neurosciences, ergonomics and emotional physiology
- philosophy of mind, ontology, episemology, aesthetics, teleology and discourse between rationalist and empiric approaches
- cultural studies, culturology, sociology of culture, communicology
- linguistics, filology, archeology, antropology and art history and criticism
- logic, argumentation and rethoric
- statistical analysis, linear, discrete and analytical algebra, calculus and classical physics
- general computer sciences, algorythmics, signal processing, computer vision, neural networks and machine learning
- etc.
in an attempt to find some basic rules that govern our visual communications:
- _physics_ of our (human) peceptual worlds
- map of the possible communication strategies in it
- _semantic mechanics_ on which all information transfer must be based
- descriptions of mechanisms that each _stylistic_ approach has choosen to take accompanied with justifications for it
- connections of nodes in each _stylistic_ mechanism to the basic perceptual _physics_ artifacts in the percieved world.
on which the technical and technological advancements in visual communications could be realistically based.
